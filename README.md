# PXS (PX Standard)
The **PXS** or **PX Standard** is about standardising the exchange and dissemination of statistical data and meta-data over a `text/plain` file type.


## [Wiki](https://github.com/CSOIreland/PXS-Standard/wiki)
The Wiki centrally hosts the versioning of the specifications about the standard:
* [PXS 0.1 `DRAFT`](https://github.com/CSOIreland/PXS-Standard/wiki/PXS-0.1-(DRAFT))
* [PXS 0.2 `DRAFT`](https://github.com/CSOIreland/PXS-Standard/wiki/PXS-0.2-(DRAFT)) _Feedback from [Statistics Finland](https://www.stat.fi/index_en.html) merged_

# Introduction
The current [PX Format](https://github.com/CSOIreland/PXS-Standard/files/5095402/px-file_format_specification_2013.pdf) is a well established format for the presentation and representation of statistical data. Its advantages include compactness and ease of reading, both for machines and humans. However, a number of shortcomings have been identified, mainly around the area of ambiguous dimensions, the presentation of data and the syntax.

The **PXS** attempts to deal with these problems by upgrading the [PX Format](https://github.com/CSOIreland/PXS-Standard/files/5095402/px-file_format_specification_2013.pdf) to the new standard.

## Format Vs Standard

A clear and simple definition of **Format** is _"a way to encode information  for storage in a computer file"_.

Instead, a **Standard** is about _"enabling the interoperability between different programs created by different developers"_.
